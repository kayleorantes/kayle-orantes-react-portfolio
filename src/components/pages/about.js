                Kayle Orantes is involved in numerous organizations in school and outside of school. She has been exposed to enrichments that is a core of what STEM signifies. Kayle has a 4.0 GPA average and perfect attendance. She is also on the High Honor Roll Student and Citizenship Honor Roll and has competed in many math competitions. She was the South Davis Jr. Highâ€™s newspaper editor, National Academic League Member, and the President for the National Junior Honor Society throughout junior high.
She was the only girl to place in the MathCounts competition, getting 6th place for individuals leading her team to a 3rd place win. She participated in the AMC-8 competition, where she placed 2nd for eighth graders and 2nd overall. She participated at WSU Prep during the summer of 2017 and got cordially invited to attend their 2018 session of the 7-week summer course, WSU Prep. She attends the Saturday Math Circle in the Bountiful Library with Beverly Ward.
She also volunteers at Adelaide Elementary in their after-school program in her spare time. She has attended the University of Utah Engineering day, Science day, the coding week with the Hill Air Force at the University of Utah. Kayle symbolizes what young women need to see, which is that just because you are a girl and women of color, it does not make you any less of a candidate to excel in the STEM field. Kayle has encouraged her peers in signing up for courses that are engineered based in her school and outside activities. Many students from her Exploring Tech class and science class will contact her with assistance to complete tasks and/or projects. While volunteering at Adelaide Elementary she was able to tutor kids in all grades with their math homework. Many of the Latino students felt comfortable seeking help from her because she looks like them. Kayle inspires young Latinas and all young women to seek and pursue courses that they might not have thought they could excel in. 
Although Kayle has not been able to have her dad present in her competitions due to him being on deployments and for her recent triumphs, she has been able to succeed and continue her persistence with being the best she can possibly be. She is an individual who strives for success and nothing less than near-perfection is okay with her. She has the dedication, persistence, passion, and drive that is needed to be successful in the STEM field. Though Kayle is my daughter, I can guarantee you that she is a young woman that will be successful in the field of STEM. She is a person that has faced challenges because of her ethnicity and gender and she has not let that influence her passion and drive for her field. It pushes her to stay grounded and educate herself as best as possible. Always pushing herself to be the best version of herself. She is a young woman that inspires and encourages her peers to seek opportunities in the STEM field.
